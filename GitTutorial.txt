DO NOT, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PUSH DIRECTLY TO MAIN BRANCH
---------------------------------------------------------

Main will act as our "PRODUCTION"


Do not push without having tested your code, and make sure that the APPLICATION runs.


Do not be afraid to break stuff, just make sure it isn't the MAIN branch.



Look at the branches
--------------------
git branch


Update your branch
------------------
git pull


Create new branch:
-------------------
git checkout -b branchName


Switch to branch:
-----------------
git checkout branchName


Delete branch:
--------------
git branch -d branchName



PUSHING
-------

You push to the branch that you have created by doing:
-------------------------------------------------------

git push origin branchName


Then on Github.com, you create a pull request to "pull" your changes into the main branch. Someone will
look at the pull request, fix any conflicts with main, and then merge your branch with main.

After this is done, your branch will be deleted.

To delete your now done branch on your local machine make sure you are on the main branch,
then do:

git branch -d oldBranchName
